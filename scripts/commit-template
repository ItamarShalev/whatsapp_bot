# Commit Message Template - No need to delete the comments, they are for guidance only.
# In order to use this template in your git commits,
# save this file as `.gitmessage` in your home directory or project root.
# Or configure git to use this template by running:
# git config commit.template scripts/commit-template
#
# Structure:
# [BUGFIX] <component>: <sub-component>: <subject>
# [optional body]
# fixes=<sha1/unknown> issue=<issue_number/none>
# Signed-off-by: Your Name <email>
#
# Rules:
# - Use imperative mood in the subject (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", not "Added", "Fixed", "Updated")
# - Lines must be no more than 72 characters (excluding "Revert" if present)
# - For bug fixes, prefix with [BUGFIX] and include fixes=<full_sha1/unknown>
# - Always add a Signed-off-by line (use `git commit -s`)
#
# Commit Message Guidelines:
# - The title should clearly explain what this patch does.
# - Subject should start with a capital letter.
# - The body should provide details on why the change is needed and any additional context.
#
# Components examples:
# - src
# - scripts
# - docs
# - workflows
# - commands
